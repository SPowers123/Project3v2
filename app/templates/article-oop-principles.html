            <h1 id="encasulation">How does the calculator Display Encapsulation</h1>
            <p class="lead">  Encapsulation is the simple act of wrapping code and data into a single unit. This can be displayed in the Getsample file.
            In this file, there is a method called getSample that collects the variables data and sample_size. It then wraps this data up by running it
            through the method random.getsample and setting the result equal to the variable random_variables. The final step is to return this variable which
            allows the method to fulfill the simple and repeatable task of getting a random sample

            <h1 id="inheritence">How does the Calculator Program Demonstrate Inheritence</h1>
            <p class="lead"> Inheritance is seen throughout the calculator program. Most notably, the <kbd>SampleMean</kbd> file shows this off the most.
            The function sample_mean uses methods and variables like addition from the <kbd>Calculator.Addition</kbd> class and the <kbd>sample_size variable</kbd> from <kbd>Statistics.Getsample</kbd>.

            <h1 id="polymorphism">How Does the Calculator Program Demonstrate Polymorphism</h1>
            <p class="lead"> Polymorphism is defined as a feature of a programming language that allows routines to use variables of different types at different times.
            In layman's terms, basically it's the action of taking methods for classes you’re inheriting from and changing them to be used in different and often more specific ways.
            The easiest to understand is how the “mean” method was changed through polymorphism to take the self and data variables and set them equal to self.result so
            that the mean can be used by the rest of the program. This is seen below:
            </p>
            
             <code class="text-black">Statistics.py</code>
        <code>
            <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">version: <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;3.2&quot;</span>

from Statistics.Mean import mean

class Statistics(Calculator):

   def mean(self, data):


       self.result = mean(data)


       return self.result


</pre></div>
</code>
            <p class="lead">  For those looking for more examples, here is a code example displaying static polymorphism. The polymorphism happening here is the method brewCoffee
            being changed through polymorphism to accept lists instead of individual objects. (code taken from stakify https://stackify.com/oop-concept-polymorphism/)</p>

        List coffees = new ArrayList(number);
        for (int i=0; i<number; i++) {

            <h1 id="abstraction">How Does the Calculator Program Demonstrate Abstraction</h1>
            <p class="lead"> Abstraction is one of the first things you would see in the calculator program. In the calculator class, 
            there are functions named addition and subtraction that call their respective classes. However, all the user sees is that
            the functions take their two variables (A and B), run them through the method, and return a new variable. The actual process
            of adding or subtracting a variable isn’t seen here which is the core basis of abstraction.
